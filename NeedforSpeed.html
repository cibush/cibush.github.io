		<div class="box bottom-left"><p>Electronic Arts is well known today for all of its sports games such as
		Madden, FIFA, and NBA. In the early 2000s EA worked on smaller titles to make ends meet. The Need for Speed
		series was one of these smaller titles.<br><br>
		Need for Speed Hot Pursuit 2 is a racing game focus on driving fancy cars while being chased by the police. The 
		driving is fast paced and controls well with drifting controls. The sense of speed it immersive with the shaking screen
		when the cars are up to speed. There is a campaign to unlock new cars and become the fastest racer there ever was.
		The game gives the player the opportunity to be the cops and run other racers off the road. Also, this game has 
		split screen so a player and their buddy can race together or work on opposites ends of the law. The game is very
		enjoyable to everyone and accessable to all skill levels.
