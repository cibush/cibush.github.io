  <p> The Playstation 2 was the 1 of the 4 six generation video game console. Sony had to compete with the Nintendo's GameCube, Microsoft's
	Xbox, and Sega's Dreamcast. With a lot of competition Sony had to devlope games that could be engage with the competition.
	This made the Playstation 2 one of the best selling video game consoles of all time. With a console like that there are 
	amazing video games to play. For this webiste I have collected 4 video games that I can recomend.</p>
