		<div class="box bottom-left"><p>Sly 2 Band of Thieves is and 3d platformer that is considered on of the best stealth games of all time 
			and one of the best Playstation 2 games of all time. After the success of the studio Sucker Punch's Sly
			Cooper Thievius Raccoonus they began working on the sequal to follow up the series. They made major improvements
			such as adding a health bar, better graphics, and overhaled the core game play.<br><br>
			The story is about a Raccoon named Sly and has to steal the body parts of Clockwerk and 
			destroy them, but before his crew can steal the parts he is caught by the police. He then
			finds out another gang has stolen the parts and goes on a mission to steal them back.<br><br>
			The player jumps, climbs, and sneak their way through missions. There is the occational mini game 
			ranging from shooting down drones to dancing in ball in a ballroom to distract a crowd. The 
			characters have amazing personalities which makes interacting with them a joy. The sound track
			makes the enviornments more immersive. This is a great start to the massive library the Playstation 2
			has.</p>
